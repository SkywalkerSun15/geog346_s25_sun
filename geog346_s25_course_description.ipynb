    "## Course Overview\n",
    "In this five-week advanced GIS course, you will learn to leverage a variety of Python libraries and frameworks to process, analyze, and visualize geospatial data. Designed for students with a foundational background in GIS, this course emphasizes the rapid acquisition of open-source data and the application of cutting-edge analysis techniques using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course begins by setting up your software environment—including creating a conda environment, integrating Git and GitHub, and configuring VS Code. You will then dive into key libraries such as GeoPandas, Rasterio, Xarray, Leafmap, WhiteboxTools, and Geemap, and learn how to streamline data acquisition from Google Earth Engine (GEE) and other open geospatial data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the course progresses, you will apply these skills to real-world problems by analyzing the impact of recent natural hazards on urban built environments. Topics include assessing wildfire damage in Los Angeles, evaluating hurricane flooding recovery using high-resolution nighttime light data, detecting “ghost cities” with satellite imagery, and performing change detection related to human activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each weekly session includes an in-class hands-on exercise, and the final class is dedicated to research project presentations, where you will propose your future GIS-related research topic.\n",
